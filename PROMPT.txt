Build a humorous web app that randomly generates fake but visually convincing correlations between absurd pairs of metrics from the world of DevOps, SRE, and software observability.

This is similar to https://tylervigen.com/

The app should have:

    A button labeled “Show Me the Causeless Chaos”

    On click, it randomly selects one metric from each of two predefined lists (e.g., “Redis cache hit rate” vs “Engineers wearing Crocs”)

    It then generates artificially correlated time series data over 10 recent dates

    The data is displayed in a dual-axis line chart using Recharts:

        Left Y-axis = Metric A

        Right Y-axis = Metric B

        X-axis = 10 past dates

    Include a computed correlation coefficient (R²) to falsely imply causality

    Show a randomly chosen sarcastic caption below the chart (e.g., “Everything graphs together if you squint hard enough.”)
