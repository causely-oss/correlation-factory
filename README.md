# Correlation Factory ðŸ”„

A humorous web app that generates fake correlations between absurd DevOps metrics. Perfect for demonstrating the dangers of spurious correlations in data science and the importance of proper statistical analysis.

## Features

- **Random Correlation Generation**: Creates fake correlations between completely unrelated DevOps metrics
- **Seeded Randomness**: Generate the same "correlation" using specific seeds for reproducible results
- **Shareable URLs**: Each correlation gets a unique URL that can be shared
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for programmatic access to correlation data
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. Click "Manufacture Correlation"
2. The app generates two random DevOps metrics
3. Creates a fake correlation between them with realistic-looking data
4. Displays the correlation with charts and statistics
5. Provides a shareable URL for the specific correlation

## API Documentation

The app provides several API endpoints:

- `GET /api/words` - Get random words for metric generation
- `GET /api/metric/[seed]/[correlationId]` - Get correlation data for specific seeds
- `GET /api/caption/[correlationId]` - Get a humorous caption for a correlation

Visit `/api-docs` for interactive API documentation.
