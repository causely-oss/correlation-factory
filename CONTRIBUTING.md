### Types of Contributions We Welcome

1. **New Metrics**: Add more absurd DevOps metrics to make the correlations even more entertaining
2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance the user interface and user experience
3. **Correlation Algorithms**: Improve the fake correlation generation algorithms
4. **Humorous Captions**: Add more sarcastic and funny captions
5. **Documentation**: Improve README, API docs, or add new documentation
6. **Bug Fixes**: Report and fix any issues you find

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/causely-oss/correlation-factory
   cd correlation-factory
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Adding New Metrics

To add new metrics, edit the `lib/data/metrics.js` file:

```javascript
// Add to devopsMetrics array for legitimate DevOps metrics
const devopsMetrics = [
  // ... existing metrics
  {
    metric: "Your new DevOps metric",
    unit: "units",
    minValue: 0,
    maxValue: 100,
  },
];

// Add to absurdMetrics array for funny/absurd metrics
const absurdMetrics = [
  // ... existing metrics
  {
    metric: "Your new absurd metric",
    unit: "units",
    minValue: 0,
    maxValue: 100,
  },
];
```

### Adding New Captions

Add new sarcastic captions to the `sarcasticCaptions` array in `lib/data/metrics.js`:

```javascript
const sarcasticCaptions = [
  // ... existing captions
  "Your new sarcastic caption here",
];
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use consistent formatting (the project uses ESLint)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code structure

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Run the development server** and test your changes manually
2. **Check the build** to ensure everything compiles correctly:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test the API endpoints** if you've modified them

### Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Commit your changes** with a clear, descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new DevOps metric: Kubernetes pod restart frequency"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - A clear title describing your changes
   - A detailed description of what you've added/changed
   - Any relevant screenshots or examples

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Add new absurd metric: Rubber duck debugging sessions")
- **Description**: Explain what you've changed and why
- **Testing**: Mention how you tested your changes
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes

### Code of Conduct
